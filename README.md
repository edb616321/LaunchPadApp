## Monitor Configuration

- **Monitor 1** (Ultra-wide 5120x1440): CCL stays here
- **M2**: Left workspace (identified by X < -3000)
- **M3**: Top-front workspace (1920x1080 at 0,0) - DEFAULT
- **M4**: Right workspace (identified by X > 3000)

## Troubleshooting

### Search not filtering files
- Search filters the **current folder only** (not recursive)
- Make sure you're in a folder that has matching files
- Check console for `[SEARCH TRIGGERED]` messages

### MPV warning "main thread is not in main loop"
- This is a non-critical threading warning
- Video playback still works
- Can be ignored

### Window positioning fails
- Some apps don't support automated positioning
- 3-second delay allows app to load before moving
- Check console for positioning debug messages

### App won't launch
- Verify the path is correct (use Browse button)
- For apps with arguments, use the `args` array in apps.json
